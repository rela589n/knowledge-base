When you are trying to learn something new, and something complex, try to **watch** some **videos** (basics) on the topic before doing this. **Take notes**.

Don't allow demotivation to slip into you. It's all right that sometimes it's hard to concentrate or you don't know something, or there are a lot of things you need to learn. Overcome this.

Use **planning**. Just a **todo list**, or maybe **roadmap**. 
Don't get confused about what to do next.

When reading the book, **ask questions**:
- What do I **expect from** this chapter?
- What do I **want to learn**?
- What I want to do with this?

You can **associate** studying **with something** (like music). When always listen particular music when studying, you just turn it on and you're automatically switched to studying mode.
