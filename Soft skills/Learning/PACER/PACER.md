PACER defines processes to process the information:

### Procedural

Procedural - how smth should be done.
Digest only with **practice**, as early as possible.

No practice - skip down or wait for the practice.

### Analogous

**Related** to prior knowledge. During Consumption, actively seek for any connection to something else.

Digest with **critique** (how good this really is):
- how is it related?
- how is it different?
- when it's inappropriate?

It drastically increases retention of digested infromation.

### Conceptual

Facts, explanations, theories, principles, relationships

Use Non-linear, Network-based **mind-Mapping** to Digest.
You don't remember sequence of words, you recreate the **Network of the knowledge**.

### Evidence

**Examples to prove Conceptual point.** 
Makes Conceptual information more concrete.

For instance, when using [[Information Expert]] principle we could compare code before and after, pros and cons.

Digest with **Store and Rehearse**:
- how to use / apply it?
- what Conceptual information is supported by it?

Problem-solving
Detailed explanations
Teaching other people

### Reference

Nitty-gritty details.

**Store and Rehearse** (if really needed).

Don't waste time remembering it. 
Spend it on Conceptual, Analogous, Procedural, and evidence types.
