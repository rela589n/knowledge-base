To learn something you must care.
If you don't care, your brain won't either.

Interest is the best leverage you have to achieve anything in life.

If you're interested in something, it fits in your brain.

Otherwise, it'd be just an isolated knowledge waiting to be forgotten.

Information must be connected and it must have a purpuse.

What you're learning must be interesting to you what.
	Otherwise it'n't work.
