There are two **phases** for remembering read information:
- **Consuming** (Reading, Watching, etc) - define [[PACER|category]];
- **Digesting** - using respective [[PACER|process]] to digest.

**Everything Consumed** must be **Digested.**

**Learning** is all about **Digestion**. 

We need to **use the knowledge** in some way; 
otherwise, there's no point in learning.

![[Knowledge usage Pyramid.png]]

You should **remember only what you need** (not everything) so that you'd be able **to use that**.

Not all information is equal to digest. 
[[PACER]] defines strategies.
