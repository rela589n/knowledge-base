That's a vital cycle with which you learn any skill:
![[Experimental Cycle.png]]

1. Experience something to be improved (target)
2. Reflect that it should be improved:
	- analyse previous setup, actions;
3. Think about what to change:
	- set up new strategy, plan;
4. Experiment to see if it brings better result.
