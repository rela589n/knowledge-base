**Request allocation timeout** - an alternative, much easier to configure, compared to [[Max queue size]], option.

Basically, this is the time (in seconds) that represents desired worst admissive [[Latency]].

Is supported by [[RoadRunner]] ([allocate_timeout](https://docs.roadrunner.dev/docs/error-codes/allocate-timeout))
