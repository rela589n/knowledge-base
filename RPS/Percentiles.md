See [[Percentiles distribution chart]].

Could be used to measure:
- [[Latency]];
- [[Response time]].

There are quartile percentiles:
- [[First quartile]];
- [[Median percentile]];
- [[Third quartile]].

Also, there are **90-th percentile**, **95-th**, **99.9-th percentiles**.

[[Service level objectives]] & [[Service level agreements]] usually are **described in percentiles**.

Algorithms to evaluate percentiles are described here: forward decay [25], t-digest [26], or HdrHistogram [27].
