Median is **50-th [[Percentiles|percentile]]**.

**Median percentile** is much more important than [[Arithmetic average]], as it represents "typical response time". 

For instance, 100ms median percentile response time would mean that 50% of all requests are completed within 100ms limit, while other 50% are above that. See [[Percentiles distribution chart]].
