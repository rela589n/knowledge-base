# Knowledge Base

This is an Obsidian vault for personal notes.

## Notes Style

- Lead with a definition + key points upfront
- Use Obsidian frontmatter with `aliases` for acronyms
- Keep it concise — avoid redundancy, use shorter language
- Prefer bullet points over paragraphs
- Keep concrete examples — they clarify better than explanations
