### Problem
Regardless of the incisiveness of the [[Domain Model]] built by architect, it must regard the complexities of the [[Code]] to hold value. Lest, developers will abandon it and implement just working software with [[Anemic model]].

### Solution
It makes a lot of sense for modelers (as they have extensive experience with tech stack they model for) to roll up their sleeves and have hands-on implementation of some features. Abstractions created will be used by other team members.
