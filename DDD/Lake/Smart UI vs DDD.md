[[Smart UI]] and [[DDD]] are mutually exclusive design choices. You can't apply both at the same time. Since in [[Smart UI]] there are no layers, no [[DDD]] concepts may be used.

[[DDD]] is not applicable for simple projects. If team has never applied the concepts of layered architecture, the project will have failed because learning curve is too expensive.

After all when applying the strategy of [[DDD]], team will face problems to overcome with the architecture itself. Even if they happen to surmount these difficulties, the built system has just simple features. It's just not worth it for simple projects.

You can't migrate application written with this approach to another design without completely rewriting the application.
