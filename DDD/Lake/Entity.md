Object having its own identity and continuity.

> Mistaken identity leads to data corruption

Most entities are implemented as ordinary objects. 
See [[Entity vs Entity Bean]].

Identity of two entities doesn't necessarily mean that objects have the same properties, or even the same class. For instance instance of `Respondent` class may be the same entity as some instance of `ResponsibleParty`.
