Currently the most ready for use paradigm is **object-oriented**:
- it balances simplicity and complexixty;
- it could be understood by non-technical people ([[Ubiquitous Language]]);
- there are a lot of people that understand it well;
- most tools provide integrations in object-oriented way.

OOP fits well for most of the projects where [[Domain Model]] is easily expressed with object.

Though, it could not fit well for mathematical domains.
