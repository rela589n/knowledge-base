Here’s what each client_auth_type means in RoadRunner gRPC TLS, and how require_and_verify_client_cert behaves.

- **no_client_certs**    
    - Server does not request a client certificate. Regular TLS (server-auth only).
    - Use when you only need to verify the server.

- **request_client_cert**
    - Server asks for a client cert but does not require it. If the client sends one, it isn’t verified against a CA.
    - Rarely useful for production; mainly for inspection/optional identity hints.

- **require_any_client_cert**
    - Server requires a client cert, but does not verify it against a CA. Any cert is accepted.
    - Only suitable in tightly controlled environments where you do additional app-level checks.

- **verify_client_cert_if_given**    
    - If the client provides a cert, the server verifies it against the configured root CA(s). If no cert is provided, the connection is still allowed.
    - Useful for mixed traffic where some clients identify via mTLS and others don’t.

- require_and_verify_client_cert    
    - Full mTLS. The server requires a client certificate and verifies it against the configured root CA(s).
    - Use this when you want strong, mutual authentication (both sides present and validate certificates).

Config essentials for require_and_verify_client_cert

- Server must have:    
    - cert and key: its own server certificate and private key.
    - root_ca: the CA (or bundle) that issued client certificates (trust anchor for client certs).
    - client_auth_type: require_and_verify_client_cert.

- Client must have:    
    - Its own certificate and private key (the client identity).
    - Trust of the server’s certificate (either system roots or the issuing CA/self-signed cert).
    - In gRPC clients, that usually means:
        - Provide server trust as root CA.
        - Provide client key + client cert for authentication.
