**Spec Collections** expose fine-grained [[Query]] methods using [[Specification API]], and basically are what [[Repository|Repositories]] were meant to be in [[Domain-Driven Design|DDD]]. 

Technically, these are implemented over [[ORM Collection]] classes.
See [[Spec Collection Example]].

These also are used to define one-to-many relationships: [[One-To-Many Relationship]].
