**Spec Collections** are [[Repository|Repositories]] in [[Domain-Driven Design|DDD]]. They expose fine-grained methods using [[Specification API]], and are based on [[ORM Collection]] classes. See [[Spec Collection Example]].

These are also used to define one-to-many relationships as well: [[Relationships as Collections]].
