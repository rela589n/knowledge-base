3-panel Liquid Crystal Display

It uses 3 panels (red, green, blue) to create the picture.
When image is built, these three panels open or close some of the pixels to create the image.

Proc:
- Better brightness than in DLP
- No rainbow effect (as in [[DLP projecting technology#^81484b]]); 

Cons:
- LCD panels degrade over time, resulting in image burn-in;
-
