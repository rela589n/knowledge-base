The **BOT model** stands for **Build–Operate–Transfer**. It’s a business engagement model often used in IT outsourcing. Let me explain in plain English using your example of two companies (a **product company** and an **intermediary**) and a **developer** hired through the intermediary:

---

### 1. **Build**

- The **intermediary company** sets up a team for the **product company**.
- This includes hiring developers, providing office space, equipment, HR, payroll, etc.
- The product company doesn’t need to handle all that hassle directly—they just get a ready-made team.

---

### 2. **Operate**

- The **intermediary company** runs the team day-to-day.
- The developers are legally employees of the intermediary, but they work **as if they’re part of the product company’s team**.
- The intermediary handles admin, HR, and operations while the developers build and maintain the product.

---

### 3. **Transfer**

- After an agreed period, the **product company** has the option to “take over.”
- That means the developers (and sometimes the whole setup) are **moved under the product company’s ownership**.
- The product company now directly employs the team and runs operations itself.

---

✅ So, in your scenario:

- The developer is initially hired by the **intermediary company**.
- They work on the **product company’s projects**.
- Later, if the transfer happens, the developer might officially become an employee of the **product company**.
