Intuition is based on the **existing knowledge** from the problems you have solved before. It's your **fast brain**, and it allows you to come up with ideas quickly.

> You can shape your intuition by shaping your future's past knowledge by shaping your intuition.

The more **correct your intuition** is, the more correct will your ideas will be. Yet, it's necessary to **double-check the ideas** before applying them.

If you are good at your intuition, you'll be able to come up with good ideas quickly.

What intuition is really all about is a mapping from problem components to the solution ideas.
