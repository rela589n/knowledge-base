Temporal doesn't recommend to setting the timeouts for workflows.

**Execution Timeout** - a complete timeout (including retries) for a [[Temporal/Workflow/Workflow|Workflow]] to execute.



**Task Timeout** - timeout for one particular [[Workflow Task]] to execute before it's sent to another [[Worker]]. Default is 10 seconds.
