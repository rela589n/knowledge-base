We can't just add changes to [[Temporal/Workflow/Workflow Definition|Workflow Definition]] and assume that everything will just run fine. The problem is with [[Workflow Replay]].

We don't version the whole [[Temporal/Workflow/Workflow Definition|Workflow Definition]], we version changes instead.

To have it, you must enable ElasticSearch.
