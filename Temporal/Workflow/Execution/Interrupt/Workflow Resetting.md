  - Reset the Workflow

**[[Workflow Execution|Workflow]] Resetting**  is terminating current problematic [[Workflow Run]], and starting new one with [[Event History]] being reset to the particular position (last successful event).

Besides that, it's possible to keep [[Signal|signals]] and [[Update|updates]], so that the workflow will continue in a different direction.
