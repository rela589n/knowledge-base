**[[Activity]] Heartbeat**  is a ping that is sent to [[Server|Temporal Service]] in order to understand that activity is still alive.

HeartBeat can include payload, so that if current [[Worker Process]] fails, a new [[Worker]] may take over the computation wherever stopped. 

[[Samples]] have an example.
