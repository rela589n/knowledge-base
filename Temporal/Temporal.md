Helps to solve the problems of distributed systems (e.g. timeouts, queues, delays, distributed transactions).

The key component of temporal is [[Temporal Server]] that has sdk for multiple languages.

It was originally created by Maxim Fateev when he worked at Uber.

Before Temporal was ever created, he used to work in amazon where they created aws swf (simple workflow service).

Temporal was created by multiple iterations that had a lot of mistakes incorporated.
