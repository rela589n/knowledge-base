This repository is an Obsidian knowledge base with Markdown notes.
## Project Structure & Module Organization
Core content lives in top-level topic folders such as `AI/`, `Database/`, `Temporal/`, `PHP/`, and `Environments/`.
Each note is self-contained and stored by topic.

## Naming Conventions
Notes are Markdown files with concise, structured writing.

Follow the guidance in `CLAUDE.md`:
- Lead with a definition and key points.
- Use Obsidian frontmatter with `aliases` for acronyms.
- Keep language concise and avoid redundancy.
- Prefer bullet points over long paragraphs.
- Include concrete examples when helpful.

File names are descriptive and use spaces where appropriate (for example, `Temporal/Workflow/Workflow Definition.md`).
Keep new files in the most relevant topic directory.
## Agent-Specific Instructions
This vault prioritizes clarity and progressive disclosure.
When contributing, keep notes short, structured, and easy to scan.
