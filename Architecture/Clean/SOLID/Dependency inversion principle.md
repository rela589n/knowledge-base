**Dependency Inversion** -  do ***depend on* abstractions** rather than concretions, achieving [[Protected Variations]] and [[Open-closed principle|OCP]].

**If** we'd ***need** to* *change / **complement*** the **implementation**,
we'd *add*  [[Decorator]], [[Proxy]]. 

**[[Dependency inversion principle|DIP]] *inverts* [[Coupling]]** (dependency) direction,
reducing the [[Coupling]] on one side,
but increasing it on the other. ^46641c
