**Iterator** allows to create **object** that is an **iterable collection** of something. It's created by implementing PHP's Iterator interfaces.

Example:
- **Query [[PHP PostgreSQL Cursor|Cursor]] Iterator**
- doctrine orm's query **toIterate()** method
- **csv iterator** (opens the file to traverse it fully)
