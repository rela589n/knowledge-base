Patterns are solutions to the common problems, also providing a commonly known [[Ubiquitous Language|Language]] of abstractions to communicate.

GOF patterns are divided into three categories:
- [[Creational Design Patterns|Creational]];
- [[Structural Design Patterns|Structural]];
- [[Behavioral Design Patterns|Behavioral]].

They provide two pictures: [[Code|Technical]], [[Domain Concept|Conceptual]]

[[Domain-Driven Design|DDD]] focuses on [[Strategy]], [[Composite]], [[Adapter]]. Also, [[Facade]].
