**Patterns** are **common solutions** to the common problems, also providing a **common [[Ubiquitous Language|Language]]** of abstractions to communicate.

GOF patterns are divided into three categories:
- [[Creational Design Patterns|Creational]];
- [[Structural Design Patterns|Structural]];
- [[Behavioral Design Patterns|Behavioral]].

They provide two **pictures**: 
- [[Code|Technical]]
- [[Domain Concept|Conceptual]] ([[Domain-Driven Design|DDD]])

[[Domain-Driven Design|DDD]] focuses on [[Strategy]], [[Composite]], [[Adapter]]. Also, [[Facade]].
