**Prototype**: ***create*** a new object ***from* the existing** 
	**without** tightly **coupling** client code up to the [[Encapsulation|internal (encapsulated)]] **structure** of the object.

Implementation of **`clone()` method** that creates new instance with cloned nested [[Composite]] structures as well.

> **Example:** customer asks to create a new **Notification Campaign** based on the existing one (**Filters**).
