Low [[Coupling]] & High [[Cohesion]]

Big code that has a lot of dependencies should be separated into smaller pieces of code (High [[Cohesion]]), that are least interdependent (Low [[Coupling]]).

These concepts play fundamental role at all scales, starting from the big ones like [[Subdomain|Subdomains]], [[Bounded Context|Bounded Contexts]], [[Module|Modules]], and down to [[Aggregate|Aggregates]] and particular classes.
