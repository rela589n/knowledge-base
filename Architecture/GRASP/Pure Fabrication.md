Something "purely fabricated", artificial thing.

When we need some code that is not related to the domain (could not be put there), like logging, web-sockets, db persistence, we could introduce this "purely fabricated" thing that stands away from the main code.

This is more of infrastructural things that have no their representatives in the domain.
