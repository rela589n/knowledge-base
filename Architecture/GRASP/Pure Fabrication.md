Something "purely fabricated", **artificial thing**, Infrastructural.

When we need some **[[Code]]** that is **not related to the [[Domain]]** (therefore it could not be put there), like **logging**, web-**sockets**, db **persistence**, we could introduce this "purely fabricated" thing that stands away from the main code.

This is more of infrastructural things that have no their representatives in the domain.
