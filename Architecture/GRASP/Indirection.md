Introducing *intermediary* (which could be an interface, or full-fledged component) between the calls.

- *Interface* - The same as [[DIP]] principle - depend on interface rather than concrete implementation.
- *Full-blown component* example: [[Adapter]], [[Facade]], [[Observer]]

In either case we aren't calling the object directly.
