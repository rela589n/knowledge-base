Names should be **brief** and **clear**.

For context-dependent tests, start name with `when`, `with`, `without`.

Each test should **test only one behavior**.

Test:
- **valid**;
- **edge**;
- **invalid** cases. 

Think of all possible inputs and test the unit.

Load as **least necessary data** as possible.
