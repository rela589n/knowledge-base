Fundamental concept of the object is to **encapsulate data with the logic** that operates on that data.

Encapsulation is the usage of [[Information Expert]], where everything private to the class remains private, and the logic is exposed via public api.

Encapsulation is granted with [[Intention-Revealing Interfaces#^3ddb73|Intention-Revealing Interfaces]], so that you **don't have to read the internals** to understand and use the code.

Encapsulation is made solid with [[Declarative]] [[Code]] (like paint mixing with color [[Value Object]]).
