Fundamental concept of the object is to **encapsulate data with the logic** that operates on that data so that developer doesn't need to know about the internals.

On a large scale, each object should be single, complete concept, the "Whole Value", whereas internals are [[Abstraction|Abstracted]].

Encapsulation is similar to [[Information Expert]], where everything private to the class remains private, and the logic is exposed via public api.

Encapsulation is granted with [[Intention-Revealing Interface#^3ddb73|Intention-Revealing Interfaces]], so that you **don't have to read the internals** ([[Abstraction]]) to understand and use the code.

Encapsulation makes [[Code]] [[Declarative]] (like paint mixing with color [[Value Object]]).
