**Polymorphism** provides **substitutability**, so that different behaviors of the system are hidden behind the **common interface**.

Swapping out the behavior based on interface implementations ([[Inheritance]]).

Code operates with the common interface, but each particular implementation may be different. [[Strategy#^d7fee7|It reduces the Coupling]]
