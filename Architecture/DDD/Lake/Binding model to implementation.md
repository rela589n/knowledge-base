> Tightly coupling the [[Code|code]] to the [[Domain Model|model]] adds meaning to the [[Code|code]] and makes the [[Domain Model|model]] relevant.

When there's some **business concept** (e.g. bus in the example of the book), it **must be present in the [[Code|code]]** as an **explicit substance** rather than a ghost, existence of which may only be inferred between the lines.

When the [[Code|code]] changes, the underlying [[Domain Model|model]] must change as well, and vice versa - changing the model must change the code.

[[Down to earth modeling]] is to be used by architects.
[[Domain must be Isolated]]
