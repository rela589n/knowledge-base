[[Domain Model]] must be [[Model Refinement|Refined]] to be [[Comprehension|Understood]] more correctly.

Terms in [[Code]] that [[Domain|Business]] knows nothing about are crutches. They signify the lack of [[Comprehension|Model Understanding]], and they are removed in case of [[Model Breakthrough]].

Another sign that [[Domain Model|Model]] is inappropriate is that [[Domain Expert|Business Experts]] say that [[Diagram]] are too technical.
