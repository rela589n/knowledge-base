[[Domain-Driven Design]]

> A lot of over-engineering has been justified in the name of flexibility. But more often than not, excessive layers of abstraction and indirection get in the way. Look at the design of software that really empowers the people who handle it; you will usually see something simple. Simple is not easy.


> Using the pattern isn't meant to be building features you don't need. They can be added later, given that concepts don't get muffled.
