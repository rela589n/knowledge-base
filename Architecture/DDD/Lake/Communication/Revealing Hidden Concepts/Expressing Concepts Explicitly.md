**Revealing hidden concepts** is understanding previously implicit the concepts of the [[Domain|Business]] that you didn't understand/know before, and using them in the [[Domain Model|Model]]. This is the driving force of the [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthroughs]].

If you find some used [[Domain Concept|Term]] that is absent from the [[Domain Model|Design]], it might improve it.

Do [[Model Refinement|Knowledge crunching]]:
- Listen to the [[Ubiquitous Language]] (most frequent [[Domain Concept|Terms]] you do not understand, nor find in the [[Domain Model|Model]]);
- Ask questions to the [[Domain Expert]], find contradictions.
- Focus on vague points of the [[Domain Model|Model]].

> You absolutely necessary for you to have a [[Domain Expert|Business Expert]], or at least somebody to answer your questions and to reveal a good [[Domain Model|Model]]. Otherwise you'd need to learn the [[Domain|Business]] by yourself and on your own using other resources.

Finally, apply learned knowledge in [[Domain Model|Model]] and [[Code]] by [[Refactoring]] it.

It brings change into the quality of the discussions, improves understanding flow, gets everyone on the same line.

It's good to have your camera on, so that they'll understand when you're confused, and when not.
