**Revealing hidden concepts** is understanding previously implicit the concepts of the [[Domain|Business]] that you didn't understand/know before, and using them in the [[Domain Model|Model]]. This is the driving force of the [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthroughs]].

If you find some used term that is absent from the [[Domain Model|Design]], it might improve it.

Do [[Model refinement|Knowledge crunching]]:
- Listen to the [[Ubiquitous Language]] (most frequent terms you do not understand, nor find in the [[Domain Model|Model]]);
- Ask questions to the [[Domain]] experts, find contradictions.
- Focus on vague points of the [[Domain Model|Model]].

> You absolutely necessary for you to have a business expert, or at least somebody to answer your questions and to reveal a good [[Domain Model|Model]]. Otherwise you'd need to learn the [[Domain|Business]] by yourself and on your own using other resources.


Finally, apply learned knowledge in [[Domain Model|Model]] and [[Code]] by [[Refactoring]] it.

It brings change into the quality of the discussions, improves understanding flow, gets everyone on the same line.

> Have your camera on, so that they'll understand when you're confused.
