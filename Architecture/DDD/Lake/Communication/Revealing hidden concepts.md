**Revealing hidden concepts** is understanding previously implicit the concepts of the [[Domain|Business]] that you didn't understand/know before, and using them in the [[Domain Model|Model]]. This is the driving force of the [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthroughs]].

Do [[Model refinement|Knowledge crunching]]:
- Listen to the [[Ubiquitous Language]] (most frequent terms you do not understand);
- Ask questions to [[Domain]] experts, find contradictions.
- Focus on vague points of the [[Domain Model|Model]].

It brings change in the quality of the discussion.

> Have your camera on, so that they'll understand when you're confused.
