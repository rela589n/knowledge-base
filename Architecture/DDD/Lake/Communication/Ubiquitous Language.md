**Ubiquitous Language** is the [[Domain Model|Model]] language that is made up of concepts that pervade [[Model Refinement|Speech]], [[Documents and Diagrams]], and even [[Code]].

This is the **intersection** between dev's language and [[Domain Experts]]' language. This is mostly **constituted by business terms** rather than dev terms.

[[Building Ubiquitous Language]]

Technically, [[Ubiquitous Language]] is expressed in **domain classes names**, most prominent **method names**, most applied **pattern names**, and other **terms used to discuss the rules**.

Everyone sticks to the same terms, team can **communicate without the [[Problems of translation layer]]**.
