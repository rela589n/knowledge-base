[[Waterfall method sucks!]]

[[Model-driven Design]] is all about model **refinements**.

**Model refinement** is **refining the [[Domain Model|Model]]** so that it makes sense [[Single Model|both]] to [[Domain Experts|Business Experts]] and to developers.

[[Model Refinements discloses weak points]].

It is built via **lots of _communication_ regarding scenarios in the model** between [[Domain Experts]] and devs. [[Good Models lie deep]].

[[Why model refinements are important]].

**[[Diagrams]]** are useful for **communication** and **brainstorming**.
