**Diagram** is **not a [[Domain Model|Model]]** itself, it's **reflection of the [[Domain Model|Model]]** useful **for explanation**. It helps to focus discussion on some aspect of the [[Domain Model|Model]] during [[Model Refinement|Refinements]].

It makes sense to have **multiple smaller diagrams** instead of one big, since full object model diagram would be too complex, wherefore not suitable for discussion. 

**Unified Modeling Language** ([[UML]]):
- [[Object interactions diagram|Object Interactions]];
- [[Class diagram]].
