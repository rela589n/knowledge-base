Both [[Domain Expert]] and **devs** have to communicate **[[Ubiquitous Language|Single Language]]**.

It should be **unambiguous** and **everyone should stick** to its terms and descriptions. The more **pervasive the language is**, the **smoother** will the **[[Comprehension]] flow** be.

> It pays of to **search for the fundamental concepts** that [[Domain|Business]] operates with before [[Model Refinement|Refinement]] using available resources, so that you'll have basic [[Comprehension]] right away.

**Talk** about the system **in domain terms**. Try to **simplify the expressions into terms** and then **bring** them into the **[[Diagram]] and [[Code]]**.

[[Domain Expert]] should **object to awkward terms**, devs should **object to inconsistencies**.

It includes [[Expressing Concepts Explicitly]].

If it is used **persistently**, then [[Model Refinements discloses weak points|weak points will float up]], 

[[Domain Model]] should become the **backbone of the [[Ubiquitous Language|Language]]** used by all team members.

Talking about the [[Domain Model|Model]] is kind of testing it, as far as we can detect its incompleteness or vagueness.

If [[Domain Expert|Experts in the Domain]] **do not [[Comprehension|Understand]] the [[Domain Model|Model]]**, it's something wrong with that [[Domain Model|Model]].  It may **start awkward** and incomplete, but it **must be [[Model Refinement| Refined]]** later on. As **[[Ubiquitous Language|Model Language]] evolves**, [[Domain Expert|Experts]] must [[Building Ubiquitous Language|adopt it]] and [[Documents and Diagrams]] have to be **retrofitted**.

[[Good Models lie deep]].
