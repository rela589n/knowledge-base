DDD focuses on the [[Domain Model]].

> Software design is a constant battle with complexity.

Domain Driven Design is **responsibility-driven design**.

DDD is about most optimal solution for given circumstances without derailing.

In DDD, [[Model refinement]], [[DDD modeling|Model-driven Design]], Implementation and [[Refactoring]] must go hand-in-hand in an iterative development process (NO [[Waterfall method]]).

Key points:
- [[DDD Communication|Communication]]
- [[Conceptual Separation is Important]]
- [[Smart UI and DDD are mutually exclusive|You can't write both DDD and Not DDD]]
- [[DDD modeling|Model-driven Design]]
- [[Domain must be Isolated]]
