  - Modularity
---
A separate part of [[Domain Model]], a set of concepts with high cohesion.

Primary aim for [[Module|modularity]] is in reduced cognitive load, since there's a limited number of things we could think about at once.

Module must tell the cohesive story of the system.
Usually as the basis of the module could be some aggregate.

Every module must be possible to be understood with minimum number of references to other modules.

Modules provide a good separation for the means of communication.

> If your [[Domain Model|Model]] is telling a story, your [[Module]] is a chapter.
