In **[[Domain Driven Design|DDD]]**, **[[Domain]] [[Model (generic)|Model]]** represents distilled knowledge of some **aspect of reality** or an **idea is of interest**.

It is rigorously organized and structured most relevant **selective abstraction of the knowledge from BA head**. 

It is not just a diagram. It is the idea that diagram conveys.

Domain model is **must have** for the **domains with rich functionality**. Not having it would turn into massive investment into ad hoc development.
