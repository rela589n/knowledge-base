**Model Breakthrough** is a drastic **elucidation about the [[Domain Model]]** that clears out all complexity, obscurity, and vagueness, and **brings out clarity**. 

It can only come as we [[Understanding|Understand]] the [[Domain Model|Model]] during the [[Model Refinement|Refinements]], [[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Reveal the hidden concepts]], and apply [[Refactoring]].

The small [[Refactoring]] has little effect, but the refactorings add up, and some of the most **important insights come abruptly** and then send a shock through the project. 

Versatility increases and the complexity evaporates.

As the result of [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]], new features are developed smoothly, requirements are clear, [[Ubiquitous Language|Everybody understands each other]], and the problems of [[Technical Debt]] are evaporated.

The initial [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]] results in the chain of other [[Domain Model|Model]] improvements, and in another [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthroughs]], increasing the value of the Product.

See example of [[Model Breakthrough from the Book]].
