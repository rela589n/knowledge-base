Useful **[[Domain Model|Models]]** usually **lie below the surface**. Some **parts of the model** that seemed important at the outset **may be discarded** once we [[Understanding|Understand]] the [[Domain]].

**Good models are built** via [[Model refinement]], which is exploration of the domain, and [[Refactoring]] that results in a [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]].

Having **good model** makes it possible for project easily to **emerge to the new powerful features** as corollaries of old ones.
