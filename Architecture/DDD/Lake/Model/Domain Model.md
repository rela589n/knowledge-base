It is rigorously organized and structured most relevant **selective abstraction of the knowledge from BA head**. 

It is not just a diagram. It is the idea that diagram conveys.

> The better your Model is right away, the less rework is needed later on. Don't obsess with it. Just make sure the [[Domain Model|Model]] is appropriate [[Domain|Business]]-wise.

Domain model is a **must have** for the **domains with rich functionality**. Not having it would turn into massive investment into ad hoc development.
