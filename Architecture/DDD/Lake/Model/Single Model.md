It is a pity when a wall-size model diagram is unusable for implementation and developers make their own ad-hoc design.

A **single [[Domain Model|Model]]** has to be used both **for analysis and software design** and other processes. If it's not, analysis model won't deal with tech complexities and become abandoned (see [[Down to earth modeling|Hands-on modeling]]).

In order to use single model, the first things necessary is to design the model in a literal way of domain, and then adjust it to fulfill technical requirements.
