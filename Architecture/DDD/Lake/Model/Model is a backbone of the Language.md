[[Domain Model]] should become the **backbone of the [[Ubiquitous Language|Language]]** used by all team members.

Talking about the [[Domain Model|Model]] is kind of testing it, as far as we can detect its incompleteness or vagueness.

If [[Domain Experts|Experts in the Domain]] **do not [[Understanding|Understand]] the [[Domain Model|Model]]**, it's something wrong with that [[Domain Model|Model]].  It may **start awkward** and incomplete, but it **must be [[Model Refinement| Refined]]** later on. As **[[Ubiquitous Language|Model Language]] evolves**, [[Domain Experts|Experts]] must [[Building Ubiquitous Language|adopt it]] and [[Documents and Diagrams]] have to be **retrofitted**.

[[Good Models lie deep]].
