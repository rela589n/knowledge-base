Procedural [[Code]] is the [[Code]], in which the programmer tells the computer a series of instructions to follow.

Even though [[Procedural Code|Transaction Script]] isolates [[Domain]]-related code from the UI, but has no domain object [[Domain Model|Model]] or has an [[Anemic model|Anemic one]].

Only few [[Domain-Driven Design]] concepts may likely be applied here.
