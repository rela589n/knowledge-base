Objects, representing "what they are" rather "who they are". 

These are used to represent descriptive aspect for another objects to form a conceptual whole. 

- [[Value Object has no identity]];
- Value-object is inherently [[Immutability|immutable]];
- [[Value Object may hold Entity]];
- [[Value Object has no bidirectional associations]].

> In some application the same concept may be represented as [[Value Object]], while in others it would be full-fledged [[Entity]], - depending on the question if the [[Identity|identity]] of this concept matters.
