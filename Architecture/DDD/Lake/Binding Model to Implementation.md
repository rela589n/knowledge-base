**[[Domain Concept|Business Concepts]]** (e.g. bus in the example of the book), **must be represented in the [[Code]]** as an **explicit substances** rather than an implicit ghosts, existence of which may only be inferred between the lines.

Tightly coupling the [[Code]] to the [[Domain Model|Model]] adds [[Comprehension|Meaning]] to both and from both perspectives ([[Code]] is obvious, and [[Domain Model|Model]] is relevant).

When the [[Domain Model|Model]] changes, the [[Code]] expressing it must change, and vice versa.

Architects should stick with [[Down to earth modeling]].

[[Domain must be Isolated]]
