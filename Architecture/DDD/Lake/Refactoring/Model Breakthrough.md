The small refactoring has little effect, but the refactorings add up, and some of the most **important insights come abruptly** and send a shock through the project. Versatility increases and the complexity evaporates. It results only as we understand the [[Domain Model|Model]], and only with [[Model refinement|Refinement]].

The Breakthrough comes as a corollary of understanding the concepts of the [[Domain|Business]] that were not known before.

Example from the book: Share Pies both apply to Facility and Loan, but Loan's Pie is changed during drawdowns, and the Loan is paid with actual shares rather than with Facility shares.

This [[Domain Model|Model]] lacks those concepts:

This has the concepts:

To set a stage for a [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]], concentrate on [[Model refinement|Knowledge crunching]], building up [[Ubiquitous Language]] by [[Revealing hidden concepts]], and apply them with [[Refactoring]].

As the result of [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]], new features are developed smoothly, requirements are clear, and [[Ubiquitous Language|Everybody understands each other]], and problems of [[Technical Debt]] are averted.

The initial [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]] results in the chain of other [[Domain Model|Model]] improvements, and in another [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthroughs]].
