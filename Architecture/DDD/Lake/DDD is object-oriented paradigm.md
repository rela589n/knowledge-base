Currently the most ready for use paradigm is **object-oriented**:
- it balances simplicity and complexity;
- it could be understood by non-technical people (facilitating [[Ubiquitous Language]]);
- there are a lot of people that understand OOP well;
- most tools provide integrations in object-oriented way.

OOP fits well for most of the projects where [[Domain Model]] is easily expressed with object.

Though, it may not fit very well for mathematical domains.

When integrating [[Rules engine]] it's important to have a single model for both objects and rules.
