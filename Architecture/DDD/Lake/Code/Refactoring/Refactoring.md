**Refactoring** is the way to reorganize the [[Code]] to incorporate new [[Domain Model|Model]] [[Comprehension|Insights]], improving the [[Domain Model|Model]], and reflecting it more correctly.

> The gospel of [[Refactoring]] is that you always go in **small steps**, and always **keep everything working**.

[[Technically-oriented Refactoring doesn't do much]]

The process of [[Refactoring]] should be conducted as [[Refactoring Toward Deeper Insight]].
