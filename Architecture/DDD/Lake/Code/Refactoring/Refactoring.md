In [[Domain-Driven Design|DDD]] Refactoring is the way to reorganize the [[Code]] to incorporate new [[Domain Model|Model]] insights, improving the [[Domain Model|Model]], and reflecting it more correctly.

> The gospel of [[Refactoring]] is that you always go in **small steps**, and always **keep everything working**.
