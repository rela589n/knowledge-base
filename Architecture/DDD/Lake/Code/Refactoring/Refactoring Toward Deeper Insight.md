**[[Refactoring]] Toward Deeper Insight** contributes to [[Model Breakthrough]]. It says that **the right way to improve the [[Domain Model|Model]] is by [[Comprehension|Understanding]] it**.

1. Live in the [[Domain]];
2. Look closely on things from different angles;
3. [[Model Refinement|Communicate]] with [[Domain Expert]] (this gives broader [[Comprehension]] for [[Refactoring]]).

##### How it all comes about?

**Initial point** is that you realize that [[Code]] is **not fitting well**, hard to [[Comprehension|Understand]], or doesn't express the [[Domain Model|Model]] clearly (disconnected from [[Model Refinement|Communication]]). 

##### What attitude should the team have?

[[Model Refinement|Communication]] with other devs who [[Comprehension|Understand]] problem [[Domain]] (or are good modelers) and [[Domain Expert|Business Experts]] trying to find useful [[Domain Model|Model]] that would make sense to [[Domain Expert|Business Experts]].

Make it productive:
- **Self-determined** team - few people arrange together to solve the problem and disband;
- **Scope and sleep** - don't be dragging out long meetings. Convene over few days.
- **Exercising [[Ubiquitous Language]]** - engage [[Domain Expert|Domain Experts]] and [[Model Refinement|Refine]] it.

A full-blown [[Model Refinement|Brainstorming]] session is dynamic, unstructured, and in-credibly productive.

##### Source to use as Basis

[[Model Refinement|Brainstorming]] is extremely useful for finding ideas from any source.

You can start with **ideas from books, web**, [[Analysis Patterns]], any other source of [[Ubiquitous Language|Domain Knowledge]] as **feed [[Model Refinement|Brainstorming]] session** and crunch the [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]] more effectively.

When the things begin to fit together, you can employ [[GOF Design Patterns|Design Patterns]] if they fit [[Domain Model|Model]] and express [[Comprehension|Meaning]].
