**[[Refactoring]] Toward Deeper Insight** contributes to [[Model Breakthrough]]. It says that **the right way to improve the [[Domain Model|Model]] is by [[Comprehension|Understanding]] it**.

1. Live in the [[Domain]];
2. Look closely on things from different angles;
3. [[Model Refinement|Communicate]] with [[Domain Expert]] (this gives broader [[Comprehension]] for [[Refactoring]]).

##### How it all comes about?

**Initial point** is that you realize that [[Code]] is:
- **not fitting well** for new features;
- **hard to [[Comprehension|Understand]]** (thus hard to work with);
- doesn't clearly express the [[Domain Model|Model]] (disconnected from [[Model Refinement|Communication]], there are [[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Implicit Concepts]]).

##### What the team should focus on?

[[Model Refinement|Communicate]] with other devs who [[Comprehension|Understand]] problem [[Domain]] (or are good modelers) and [[Domain Expert|Business Experts]] trying to find useful [[Domain Model|Model]] that would make sense to [[Domain Expert|Business Experts]].

Make it productive:
- **Self-determined** team - few people arrange together to solve the problem and disband;
- **Scope and sleep** - don't be dragging out long meetings. Convene over few days.
- **Exercising [[Ubiquitous Language]]** - engage [[Domain Expert|Domain Experts]] and [[Model Refinement|Refine]] it.

A full-blown [[Model Refinement|Brainstorming]] session is dynamic, unstructured, and in-credibly productive.

##### What Source to start with

[[Model Refinement|Brainstorming]] is extremely useful for finding ideas from any source.

You can start with **ideas from books, web**, [[Analysis Patterns]], any source of [[Ubiquitous Language|Domain Knowledge]] and **feed the [[Model Refinement|Brainstorming]] session** with it and crunch the [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]] more effectively.

When the things begin to fit together, you can employ [[GOF Design Patterns|Design Patterns]] if they fit the [[Domain Model|Model]] and express the [[Comprehension|Meaning]].

Likewise, you can [[Drawing on Established Formalisms|Draw on Established Formalisms]].

##### If you wait it, you don't do it

If you wait until it's justified, you've waited too long.

**Continuous [[Refactoring]]** is the Best Practice. It keeps [[Technical Debt]] low.

Teams are cautious about it:
- risks of change;
- cost of change.

Yet, on the other hand **there is <u>higher cost</u> of not doing it**:
- risk of keeping an incomprehensible design;
- cost of [[When you're Making Crutches, it's the problem of the Model|Working Around]] it.

Development is not such a predictable process that change vs no change can be accurately calculated.

**[[Refactoring]] must be considered as part of the process**, part of the ongoing exploration of the [[Domain]], not as something that devs brag about.

[[Technical Debt]] is not a laughing matter.

##### Refactor

[[Refactoring|Refactor]] constantly, seek for opportunities for a [[Flexible Design]] and [[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Make the implicit concepts explicit]].

But don't do it the day before release.

Make sure [[Domain Expert|Domain Experts]] [[Comprehension|Understand]] your suggested [[Domain Model|Model]]. They are the primary people for validation.

##### This Model Stinks - Opportunity Point

Once in a while it may come about that **current [[Domain Model|Model]] looks poor**, and not as it first looked like. This means you've reached **new level of [[Comprehension|Understanding]]**, and [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]] can produce far better [[Domain Model|Model]].
