**[[Refactoring]] Toward Deeper Insight** leads to **[[Model Breakthrough]]**. 

You can only **improve the [[Domain Model|Model]]** by **[[Comprehension|Understanding]] it** first.

1. Live in the [[Domain]];
2. Look closely on things from different angles;
3. [[Model Refinement|Communicate]] with [[Domain Expert]] (this gives broader [[Comprehension]] for [[Refactoring]]).

##### How it all comes about?

**Initial point** is that you realize that **[[Code]] is**:
- **not fitting** for the new features, 
	- because it's -> **hard to [[Comprehension|Understand]]** (and to work with)
		- since it **doesn't express the [[Domain Model|Model]]**,
			- being **disconnected from [[Model Refinement|Communication]]**,
			- and having **[[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Implicit Concepts]]**

##### What team should undertake

**[[Model Refinement|Communicate]] with:**
- **Other devs**
   *who* **[[Comprehension|Understand]] the [[Domain]]**,
   *or* are **good modelers**;
- **[[Domain Expert|Business Experts]]**:
	- find useful **[[Domain Model|Model]]**
	  *that* would **make sense** to them.

Be productive:
- **Self-determined** team:
	- few people arrange together 
	  *to* solve the problem and disband;
- **Scope and sleep**:
	- Convene over few days;
	- Don't drag out long meetings;
- **Exercise [[Ubiquitous Language]]**
	- engage [[Domain Expert|Domain Experts]] and [[Model Refinement|Refine]] it.

A full-blown [[Model Refinement|Brainstorming]] session is dynamic, unstructured, and in-credibly productive.

##### What Source to start with

[[Model Refinement|Brainstorming]] is useful for finding ideas from any source.

To [[Model Refinement|Crunch]] the [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]] more effectively,
you can **feed the [[Model Refinement|Brainstorming]] session** with:
- ideas from **books and internet**;
- **[[Analysis Patterns]]**
- any source of [[Ubiquitous Language|Domain Knowledge]]

When the things begin to fit together, you can [[Refactoring|Refactor]]:
- employ [[GOF Design Patterns|Design Patterns]] 
  (*if* they fit the [[Domain Model|Model]] 
   *and* express the [[Comprehension|Meaning]])
- [[Drawing on Established Formalisms|Draw on Established Formalisms]]

##### If you wait it, you don't do it

If you wait until it's justified, 
*you've* waited too long.

**Continuous [[Refactoring]]** is the Best Practice. 
It keeps [[Technical Debt]] low.

Teams could be cautious about it:
- risks of change;
- cost of change.

On the other hand **not doing it** gives <u><b>higher cost</b></u> :
- risk of keeping an **<u><b>In</b></u>[[Comprehension|comprehensible]] design**;
- cost of [[When you're Making Crutches, it's the problem of the Model|Working Around]] it.

Development is not such a predictable process that change vs no change can be accurately calculated.

**[[Refactoring]] must be considered as part of the process**, part of the ongoing exploration of the [[Domain]], not as something that devs brag about.

[[Technical Debt]] is not a laughing matter.

##### Refactor

[[Refactoring|Refactor]] constantly.
Seek for opportunities for a [[Flexible Design]] 
and [[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Make the implicit concepts explicit]].

But don't do it the day before release.

Make sure [[Domain Expert|Domain Experts]] [[Comprehension|Understand]] your suggested [[Domain Model|Model]]. They are the primary people for validation.

##### This Model Stinks - a Point of Opportunity

Once in a while it may find 
*that* **current [[Domain Model|Model]] looks poor**, 
*and* not as it first looked like. 

This means you've reached **new level of [[Comprehension|Understanding]]**, 
*and* [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]] can produce far better [[Domain Model|Model]].
