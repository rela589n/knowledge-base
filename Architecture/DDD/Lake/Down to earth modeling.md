See [[Software Development vs Manufacturing]].
#### Problem
Regardless of the incisiveness of the [[Domain Model]] built by the architect, it must **regard the complexities of the [[Code|code]]** in order to hold value, lest developers will abandon it and implement "just working" feature with [[Anemic model]].
#### Solution
It makes a lot of sense for modelers (as they have extensive experience with tech stack they model for) to roll up their sleeves and to **implement the features themselves**. Abstractions created by them will be used by other team members.
