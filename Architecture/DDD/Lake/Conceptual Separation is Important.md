Without Delivery Specification ([[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Explicit Concept]]), the Cargo object would be responsible for the **detailed meaning** of all those **attributes** and associations for specifying the delivery goal. This would **clutter up** Cargo and make it harder to [[Comprehension|Understand]] or change.

Separation provides conceptual clarity, and [[Ubiquitous Language|terms]] that can be used in [[Model Refinement|Communication]].
