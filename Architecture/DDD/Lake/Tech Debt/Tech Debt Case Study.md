The total productivity of the total stuff members is reaching toward the limit:

Cost per line of code:

Productivity of the developers compared to initial (the initial release's productivity is taken as 100%):
![[Productivity compared to an initial release.png]]

> Over the next releases developers could produce less lines of code due to already written [[Technical Debt|Technical Burden]] of the written [[Code]] that could not be maintained.


The initial payroll was only few hundred thousand dollars, but it kept growing on each release until it finally reached 20 million.

> Due to the [[Technical Debt#^a11b5e|complexity]], the team could not perform as many tasks as they used to, so new devs were hired, but it couldn't be solved with just new staff because people do not understand what's going on in the code. 
> 
> From high-level perspective, it might seem that higher-level devs (they cost more) could understand it, but that's not true. 
> 
> If the code is written poorly, it almost does not matter what grade of the dev is. It's just hardly possible to find any meaning therein.
