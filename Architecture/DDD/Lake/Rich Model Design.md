Rich [[Model-driven Design|Model Design]] goes beyond just "find the nouns". When you hear the word, you **have a lead**, which you follow in the conversation with the goal of carving out useful [[Domain Concept]]. 

It has the actual **[[Domain|Business]] rules**, consolidates **[[Domain]] activities** and reflects the insight of the [[Domain]].

[[Good Models lie deep]].

[[When you're making crutches, it's the problem of the Model]]

It happens that **[[Domain|Business]] rules are inconsistent**. [[Domain Experts]] **reconcile the contradictions** and **fill the gaps**, though for software to do it, it is necessary to have full [[Understanding|Comprehension]] of the [[Domain|Business]], which is only possible by close collaboration with [[Domain Experts|Business Experts]] during **[[Model Refinement]]** sessions.

**Good [[Domain Model|Design]] is built by trial and error**. There's just no other way. You experiment with knowledge in [[Model Refinement|Refinement Discussions]], dig down [[Domain Concept|Concepts]], use them in the [[Domain Model|Model]], continually improving it.

From the [[Code]] perspective, sometimes it is necessary to [[Extracting a hidden concept|make a vague implicit concept become clear and explicit]].
