DDD focuses on the [[Domain Model]].

> Software design is a constant battle with complexity. 
> DDD is all about taming this complexity.

DDD is about most optimal solution for given circumstances without derailing.

DDD aims for flexible, supple [[Domain Model|Model]] that can be adapted to new use cases easily.

DDD is responsibility-driven design ([[Model that corresponds to Implementation]]).

DDD accelerates the learning curve, because [[Model that corresponds to Implementation|Model is bound to Implementation]].

In DDD, [[Model refinement]], [[Model-driven Design|Model-driven Design]], [[Code|Implementation]] and [[Refactoring|Refactoring toward deeper insight]] must go hand-in-hand in an iterative development process (NO [[Waterfall method]]).

Key points:
- [[DDD Communication|Communication]]
- [[Conceptual Separation is Important]]
- [[Domain-Driven Design is about simplicity, not over-engeeniring]]
- [[Smart UI and DDD are mutually exclusive|You can't write both DDD and Not DDD]]
- [[Model-driven Design|Model-driven Design]]
- [[Domain must be Isolated]]
