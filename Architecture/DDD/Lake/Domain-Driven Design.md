DDD focuses on the [[Domain Model]].

> Software design is a constant battle with complexity. 
> DDD is all about taming this complexity.

DDD is about most optimal solution for given circumstances without derailing.

DDD aims for flexible, supple [[Domain Model|Model]] that can be adapted to new use cases easily, and allows [[Code]] to be reused easily.

DDD is responsibility-driven design ([[Binding Model to Implementation]]).

DDD accelerates project onboarding, because [[Binding Model to Implementation|Model is bound to Implementation]].

Encountering a change that isn't localized and requires a substantial change to the [[Domain Model|Model]] is a message: our [[Understanding]] needs [[Model Refinement|Refinement]]. It presents an opportunity to [[Good Models lie deep|Deeper the Model]] and bring a [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]].

In DDD, [[Model Refinement]], [[Model-driven Design|Model-driven Design]], [[Code|Implementation]] and [[Refactoring Toward Deeper Insight]] must go hand-in-hand in an iterative development process (NO [[Waterfall method]]).

Key points:
- [[DDD Communication|Communication]]
- [[Conceptual Separation is Important]]
- [[Domain-Driven Design is about simplicity, not over-engeeniring]]
- [[Smart UI and DDD are mutually exclusive|You can't both write DDD and Not DDD]]
- [[Model-driven Design|Model-driven Design]]
- [[Domain must be Isolated]]
