  - You can't write both DDD and Not DDD

[[Smart UI]] and [[Domain Driven Design]] are mutually exclusive. You can't apply both at the same time. Since in [[Smart UI]] there are no [[DDD Layered Architecture|Layers]], no [[Domain Driven Design|DDD]] can be used.

[[Domain Driven Design]] is not applicable for simple projects. [[Starting DDD for simple projects isn't good idea]].

You can't migrate application written with this approach to another design without completely rewriting the application.
