**Bounded Context** is a demarcation of [[Domain Model|Domain Models]] that make different subsystems.

It is usually **delimited by distinctive subsystems** having its own [[Ubiquitous Language]], and often developed by different teams / departments.

Total [[Domain Model#^3cfe8a|Unification]] of the [[Domain Model]] in a large system isn't feasible or cost-effective. Optimal is for [[Bounded Context|Bounded Contexts]] to expose their own [[Domain Model|Models]].
