**Bounded Context** defines a **range of applicability of each [[Domain Model]]**. It is used to **delimit distinctive subsystems** having **its own [[Ubiquitous Language]]**, that can be developed by different teams / departments.

Total [[Domain Model#^3cfe8a|Unification]] of the [[Domain Model]] in a large system isn't effective. Most optimal is when [[Bounded Context|Bounded Contexts]] to expose their own small [[Domain Model|Models]] rather than one big over-arching [[Domain Model|Model]].

**Continuous Integration** keeps the [[Domain Model|Model]] [[Domain Model#^3cfe8a|Unified]].
