**Bounded Context** demarcates a **range of applicability (context) of each [[Domain Model]]**. It is used to **delimit distinctive subsystems** having **its own [[Ubiquitous Language]]**, that can be developed by different teams / departments.

Total [[Model Unification|Unification]] of the [[Domain Model]] in a large system isn't effective. Most optimal is when [[Bounded Context|Bounded Contexts]] to expose their own small [[Domain Model|Models]] rather than one big over-arching [[Domain Model|Model]].

Context of the [[Domain Model|Model]] is a set of conditions under which [[Domain Concept|Model Terms]] have specific meaning.

[[Context Map]]

**Continuous Integration** keeps the [[Model Unification]].
