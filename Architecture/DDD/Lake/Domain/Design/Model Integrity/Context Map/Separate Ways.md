**Separate Ways [[Context Integration Strategies|Relationship]]** - [[Bounded Context|Bounded Contexts]] are **completely independent** and have **nothing shared**.

**Integration** is always **expensive**.
Sometimes it's **more trouble** *than* **it's worth**.
**Some** integrations add **little value**.

Sometimes we can propose **simple alternatives**, 
which are **much cheaper** than full integration.

If full integration will be necessary anyway, 
it can be developed **later**.
