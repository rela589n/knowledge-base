Situation: 
  you have a bunch of **new systems**
	  *that* **communicate** *with* **[[Legacy]]** 
		  *through* **[[Anti-Corruption Layer]]**.

You should ***cover* new systems** with **[[Testing|Tests]]**.

**Phase out** features in **small**, **iteration**-sized units. 
Don't get all features in one go.

**Deployment** should be as **iteration**-sized as features.
