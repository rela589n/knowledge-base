[[Shared Kernel]] into single [[Bounded Context|Context]]

1. Unify [[Continuous Integration]] processes across the teams;
2. **Circulate team members** between [[Bounded Context|Contexts]] to build a shared knowledge of both;
3. Clarify [[Distilling the Model|Distillation]] for both;
4. Merge [[Core Domain]] into [[Shared Kernel]]:
	- Approaches:
		- Stick with one, modify the other;
		- New [[Domain Model|Model]] to cover both (difficult);
5. Increase [[Continuous Integration|Integration]] frequency until it becomes [[Continuous Integration]].

Finally, you will have **one large team** 
*working* on the **same codebase**.
