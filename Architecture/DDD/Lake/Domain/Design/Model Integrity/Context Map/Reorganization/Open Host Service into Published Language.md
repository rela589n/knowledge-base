[[Open Host Service]] into [[Published Language]]

Sometimes [[Published Language]] provides a better, easier to understand way of integrating. 

First of all, **check** if there's any **industry**-wide **[[Published Language|Language]]**:
- if so, use it.

Otherwise:
- Use **[[Core Domain]]** as the **basis** for **[[Published Language]]**:
	- keep **[[Translation Layer]]** to allow [[Refactoring]];
- Publish the [[Published Language|Language]];
- Update [[Open Host Service]].
