For External Systems [[Context Integration Map|Integration]] can be:

[[Separate Ways]] - is it really necessary to [[Context Integration Map|Integrate]]? Maybe users can be given **access to both systems** and do **w/o integration**? [[Context Integration Map|Integration]] is really expensive and distractive.

[[Anti-Corruption Layer]] - when your system is going to be more involved, and more important that just appendix to the third-party.

[[Customer-Supplier]] - when they are ready to collaborate and build something specifically for us.
