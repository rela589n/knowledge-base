[[Separate Ways]] - is it really necessary to [[Context Integration Map|Integrate]]? Maybe users can be given access to both systems and do w/o integration? [[Context Integration Map|Integration]] is really expensive.

[[Anti-Corruption Layer]] - when your system is going to be more involved that just appendix to the third-party.

[[Customer-Supplier]] - when they are ready to collaborate and can build something specifically for us.
