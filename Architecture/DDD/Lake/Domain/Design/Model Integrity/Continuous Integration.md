**Continuous Integration** means that all **the work** within single [[Bounded Context]] **is integrated quickly** so that it's easy to detect and **fix [[Model Contradictions]] quickly**.

[[Continuous Integration]] tames [[Model Contradictions|Model Fragmentation]] and keeps the [[Model Consistency|Model Unified]] within the [[Bounded Context]]. Especially valuable when the team increases.

[[Continuous Integration]] is first **about [[Domain Concept|Concepts]]** - building common [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]] in the team, and then it's **about [[Code]]**:
- continuous (**frequent**, daily);
- integration (**build, test, merge**).

**[[Domain Concept|Conceptual]] Integration** - you integrate [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]] to other team members. It smooths the [[Code|Implementation]].

Set up **frequent merges** and **automatic tests**.
Communicate [[Ubiquitous Language]].

**Uncoordinated teams** working on closely related features might **go on for a while**, but usually their **work eventually don't match up** and they have to spend time on fixing [[Translation Layer]] that they should've **spent on [[Continuous Integration]]**.

The sooner both teams talk about (and integrate) the changes the better.
