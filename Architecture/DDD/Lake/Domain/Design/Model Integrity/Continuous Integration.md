**Continuous Integration** means that all **the work** within single [[Bounded Context]] **is integrated quickly** so that it's easy to detect and **fix [[Integrity Problems]] quickly**.

[[Continuous Integration]] tames [[Integrity Problems|Model Fragmentation]] an keeps the [[Model Unification|Model Unified]] within the [[Bounded Context]]. Especially valuable when the team increases.

[[Continuous Integration]] is first **about [[Domain Concept|Concepts]]** - building common [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]] in the team, and then it's **about [[Code]]**:
- continuous (**frequent**, daily);
- integration (**build, test, merge**).

**[[Domain Concept|Conceptual]] Integration** - you integrate [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]] to other team members. It smooths the [[Code|Implementation]].

Set up frequent merges and automatic tests.
Communicate [[Ubiquitous Language]].

**Uncoordinated teams** working on closely related features might **go for a while**. Yet, usually their **work don't match together** in the end so they have to spend time on fixing [[Translation Layer]] that they might've **spent on [[Continuous Integration]]**.

The sooner both teams talk about the changes the better.
