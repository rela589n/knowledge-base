**Dialect** - the **same [[Domain Concept|Concept]]** may be *represented from* **different angles** (like [[Elephant Perception#^4c61c2|Elephant]]) in different [[Bounded Context|Contexts]]:

- basically, **it's [[Duplicate Concept]]**,
- *with* **each** having own **fine-tuned [[Ubiquitous Language|Jargon]]**:
	- Some things are unique, 
	  *but* some things represent the same [[Domain Concept|Thing]] 
	  (*e.g.* snake vs fire hose, tusk vs stick).

It's **fraught** with:
- loss of [[Ubiquitous Language|Shared Language]] reduces [[Model Refinement|Communication]];
- overhead of [[Translation Layer|Translation]] during [[Context Integration Map|Integration]];

How valuable is that jargon, peculiar to the [[Bounded Context]]? Sometimes it's just more trouble than it's worth.

Weigh the value of specific dialects against [[Context Integration Map|Integration]] cost.
