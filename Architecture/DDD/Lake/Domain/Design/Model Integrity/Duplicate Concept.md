Duplicate [[Domain Concept|Concept]] is when there are two things (and thus implementations) that represent the same [[Domain Concept|Concept]].

The main problem is keeping them synchronized.
Every time one is changed, the change of other is also required.

> **For example**, 
> If the [[Specification]] broken down, it would result in [[Duplicate Concept]] (one for db, one for object check).
