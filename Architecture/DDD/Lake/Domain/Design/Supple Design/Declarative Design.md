**[[Declarative]] Design** is a Holy Grail of [[Model-driven Design]].
You ***define* [[Domain Model|Model]]** properties, and the **rest** of the [[Code]] needed to work ***is organized*** via reflection, generated, or what not.

In practice, it's **fraught *with* problems** due to the **limitations *of*** the **frameworks**, that doesn't allow to express some of the **specifics *of the* [[Domain Model|Model]]**.

Everyone must follow the rules of the framework in order to get the [[Declarative]] design. Thereby, [[Domain Model|Model]] might be corrupted.

The **greatest value** is **fine-grained** libraries that specialize at some particular thing (like [[ORM]]). 
These ***relieve*** you ***from*** **drudge work**, leaving freedom in design (yet within limits).
