**Supple Design** is expressive, adaptable, flexible, [[Model-driven Design]] that **communicates its intent**.

**Software** is for users just as for developers who need to support it. Clarity of [[Comprehension|Understanding]] is crucial.

It adds **clarity the [[Domain Model|Model]]**, limits [[Conceptual Overload]] by:
- [[Intention-Revealing Interface|Intention-Revealing Interfaces]] ([[Expressing Concepts Explicitly]]);
- [[Conceptual Boundary|Conceptual Boundaries]] (Reducing [[Low Coupling & High Cohesion|Dependencies]]);
- [[Distilling the Model]];
- [[Declarative Style of Design]];
- Easy to anticipate **the [[Side-Effect|Consequences]] of running [[Code]]**:
	- [[Side-Effect-Free Functions]]
	- [[Assertion|Assertions]]
- It [[Drawing on Established Formalisms|Draws on Established Formalisms]], and uses [[Closed Operation|Closure of Operations]].

[[Flexible Design]] aims for flexibility where it's necessary and simplicity elsewhere.

It is achieved by [[Refactoring Toward Deeper Insight]].
