**Intention-Revealing Interfaces** [[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Express Concepts Explicitly]]. They present objects as [[Domain Concept|Concepts]] of [[Comprehension|Meaning]] rather than just technical mechanisms.

If developer is forced to read the implementation because he's unable to **grasp** meaning **from the interface**, the [[Encapsulation]] is lost. ^3ddb73

It's the matter of making **[[Code]] grained to each [[Domain Concept|Concept]]** so that every method is fairly simple and when dev opens it, he'll sees  it's just obviously expressing itself in [[Declarative]] manner and using [[Ubiquitous Language|Business Terms]].

Type names, method names, parameter names, - all those serve for the sake of Intention-Revealing **[[Declarative]] Interfaces**.
