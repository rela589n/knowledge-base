**Assertions** are statements about [[Post-Condition|Post-Conditions]] that make it easy to **anticipate the [[Side-Effect|Consequences]] of execution**.

They clearly state what state ([[Side-Effect|Side-Effects]]) system ends up with after [[Command]] execution.

These can be written in [[Tests]], and must cover all reasonable [[Side-Effect|Side-Effects]] that happen to the system.
