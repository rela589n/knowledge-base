**[[Domain Concept|Conceptual]] Boundary** define the **scope of the [[Domain Concept|Concept]]**, and if structured accordingly, it **reduces [[Low Coupling & High Cohesion|Dependencies]]**.

[[Low Coupling & High Cohesion]] applies to [[Domain Concept|Domain Concepts]] as well as to [[Code]].

Apply them to **detect the [[Conceptual Boundary|Boundaries]]** of [[Subdomain|Subdomains]], [[Bounded Context|Bounded Contexts]], [[Module|Modules]], [[Aggregate|Aggregates]], and particular classes.

Observe the [[Axis of change|Axes of change]] and Axes of stability during [[Refactoring]] to [[Comprehension|Understand]] the [[Conceptual Boundary|Conceptual Boundaries]].

Don't split the implementation if there's no [[Conceptual Boundary]] there. Half of uranium atom isn't uranium.
