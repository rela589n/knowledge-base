**Generic Subdomain** is an independent **supporting part** 
that doesn't capture [[Core Domain]] [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]].

The **importance** of supportive things directly 
***depends*** *on how* they **support the [[Core Domain|Core]]**.

It's ***contrary to*** the **[[Core Domain]]**, wherefore its **priority is lower**.
Therefore, don't distract [[Core Team]].

Represented as a **separate [[Module]]** in the code.

Generic Subdomains enable you to use **outside expertise**.
There are [[Solutions for Generic Subdomains]].

> Often top tech people enjoy definable problems, which are usually the simplest. Yet, disciplined look says that priority is in [[Core Domain|Core]].

**Generic *doesn't mean* Reusable**. 
It might or might be not reusable.

Most of the **effort** should go into **[[Core Domain]]**. 
Supportive things - only necessary.
