### Off-the-shelf solution

**Buy implementation** or use an **[[Opensource]]**.

**Advantages**:
- less to develop;
- maintenance externalized;
- tested, more **mature**;
- support, **documentation**.

**Disadvantages**:
- **time** for **research** and **learn**;
- **quality** is questionable;
- overengineered - **integration** could take **time**;
