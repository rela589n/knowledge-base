  - Standalone Class

Every [[Association]], every dependency contributes to conceptual load. To **[[Comprehension|Understand]] the class** it's needed to [[Comprehension|Understand]] the **relationship with its dependencies**.

The bigger is the **number of things we have to keep in mind** to understand the [[Domain Concept|Concept]], the more overloaded it becomes.

**[[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Implicit Concepts]]** contribute to [[Conceptual Overload]] even more than explicit dependencies. They also **are needed to be understood**, but it's harder as they are "ghosts" whose existence we can only imply.

**[[High Cohesion & Low Coupling|Low Coupling]]** (defining [[Conceptual Boundary|Conceptual Boundaries]]) is fundamental to **coping with [[Conceptual Overload|Conceptual Load]]**. Each [[Module]], each Class must be as self-contained as possible (Standalone Classes).
