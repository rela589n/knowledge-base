**[[Domain Model|Model]] Consistency** - imperative property of the [[Domain Model|Model]] 
to *have* **no [[Model Contradictions|Contradictions]]** and *be* internally **[[Consistency|Consistent]]**:
- **[[Invariant|Invariants]] are kept**;
- **[[Domain Concept|Terms]] are unambiguous**;
- **[[Business Rule|Rules]] do not contradict**.

It's the most fundamental requirement of the [[Domain Model|Model]] that makes it usable.

Whether to keep [[Bounded Context|Contexts]] unified or separate should depend on pros and cons of both. See [[Context Integration Map|Context Mapping]].

If there's no enough knowledge about the [[Domain Concept|Conceptual]] makeup of the [[Domain Model|Model]], it can be gained by [[Model Refinement|Refinements]], leading to [[Model Breakthrough]].
