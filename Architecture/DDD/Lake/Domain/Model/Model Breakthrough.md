**Model Breakthrough** is a drastic **elucidation about the [[Domain Model]]** that clears off all complexity, obscurity, and vagueness, and **brings about clarity**. 

It can only come as we [[Comprehension|Comprehend]] the [[Domain Model|Model]] in [[Model Refinement|Refinements]], [[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Reveal the hidden concepts]], and apply the [[Refactoring]].

Small [[Refactoring]] has little effect, but as it **add up**, the **important insights come abruptly** and send a **shock** through the project. 

Versatility increases and the complexity evaporates.

The result of [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]] is that:
- new features are developed smoothly;
- requirements are clear;
- [[Ubiquitous Language|Everybody understands each other]];
- the problems of [[Technical Debt]] are evaporated.

The initial [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthrough]] results in the **chain** of other **[[Domain Model|Model]] improvements**, and other [[Model Breakthrough|Breakthroughs]], increasing the value of the Product.

See example of [[Model Breakthrough from the Book]].
