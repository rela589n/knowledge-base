**Distillation** - separation of the components and extracting the **essence**. 

It allows to *hew away* **distractions** 
and *focus* on what matters **most**.

One must set **priorities** to the **[[Core Domain]]**, 
and allocate highly **skilled devs** to implement it.

Concepts:
- [[Core Domain]]
- [[Generic Subdomain]]
- [[Coherent Mechanism]]

See [[Project Risk Management]]

Domain design is interesting and challenging when approached seriously.
