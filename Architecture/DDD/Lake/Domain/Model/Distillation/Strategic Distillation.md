**Distillation** - strategic **separation** of the components 
to delineate the **essence** from inessential.

It allows to *hew away* **distractions** 
and *focus* on what matters **most**.

One must set **priorities** to the **[[Core Domain]]**, 
and allocate highly **skilled devs** to implement it.

Separation:
- [[Core Domain]] (big effect)
- [[Generic Subdomain]]

Docs:
- [[Domain Vision Statement]]
- [[Highlighted Core]]
- [[Cohesive Mechanism]]

See [[Project Risk Management]]

Domain design is interesting and challenging when approached seriously.
