**Distillation** - separation of the components and extracting the **essence**. 

It allows to *hew away* **distractions** 
and *focus* on what matters **most**.

One must set **priorities** to the **[[Core Domain]]**, 
and allocate highly **skilled devs** to implement it.

Concepts:
- [[Core Domain]]
- [[Generic Subdomain]]
- [[Coherent Mechanism]]

Domain design is interesting and challenging when approached seriously.

#### Risk management

Generic subdomains are **easier to analyze**. 
Yet, it's risky to shift focus from [[Core Domain|Core]], which is the most important and valuable thing.

Modeling risks:
- unforeseen **complexity**;
- lack of ***access*** to **business experts**;
- gaps in **devs skills**.

[[Core Domain]] is high risk, because w/o it project can't succeed.
