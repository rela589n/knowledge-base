Even though [[Generic Subdomain]]s are **easier to analyze**,
**dispersing *oneself* is risky**, since it shifts focus from the **[[Core Domain|Core]]**, 
which is the **most valuable** and important thing.

Modeling risks:
- unforeseen **complexity**;
- poor ***access*** to **business experts**;
- gaps in **devs skills**.

[[Core Domain]] is high risk, because w/o it project can't succeed.
