**Distillation Document** - a [[Design Documents and Diagrams|Document]] containing most **essentials objects** and **relationships**, usually represented as [[Diagram]].

It provides a **broad view** of the [[Domain Model|Model]], ***focusing*** 
on ***how*** main **parts fit** together.

Usually it's to be understood by **non-technical** people.

It's an **indicator of importance** of a change.
**Changes** to the doc **originate** from:
- **changes** to the **[[Core Domain|Core]]**;
- *or* **changes** to its **boundaries**.
Anyhow, these **require**:
- **consultation** to other team members;
- **notification** of all.
