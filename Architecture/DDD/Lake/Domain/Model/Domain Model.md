**[[Domain]] [[Model (generic)|Model]]** is a **[[Distilling the Model|Distilled]] [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]]** *of* **[[Domain]]** (of some **aspect of reality** or an **idea of interest**).

It is rigorously organized, structured most relevant **selective abstraction** of the [[Ubiquitous Language|Knowledge]] from the **head of [[Domain Expert|BA]]**. 

[[Domain Model|Model]] captures the **conceptual core**, **vision of the system**.

It must be kept [[Unified Model|Consistent]].

It is not just a [[Diagram]].
It is the [[Comprehension|Idea]] that [[Diagram]] conveys.

[[Domain-Driven Design|DDD]] emphasizes on use of a [[Single Model]].

> The better your [[Domain Model|Model]] is right away, the less rework is needed later on. Don't obsess with it. Make sure that [[Domain Model|Model]] is appropriate [[Domain|Business]]-wise.

[[Domain Model]] is a **must have** for the **[[Domain|Domains]] with rich functionality**. Not having it would turn into massive investment into ad hoc development.

Some specialized [[Domain Model|Model]] that can handle some need must give way to a more generic [[Domain Model|Model]] that can handle all situations.
