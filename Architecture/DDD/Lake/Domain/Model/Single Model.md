It is a pity when a wall-size model [[Diagram]] is unusable for [[Code|Implementation]] and developers make their own ad-hoc design.

A **single [[Domain Model|Model]]** must be used both **for analysis and for software design** and other processes. If it's not, analysis model won't deal with tech complexities and become abandoned (see [[Down to earth modeling|Hands-on modeling]]).

In order to use **single [[Domain Model|Model]]**, the first thing necessary is to design the [[Domain Model|Model]] in a literal way of the [[Domain]], and then adjust it to fulfill technical requirements.
