**Subdomain** is a broader concept than [[Bounded Context]] and may hold **multiple [[Bounded Context|Bounded Contexts]]**, though in ideal world, it's 1-1 relationship.

Subdomains:
- [[Core Domain]] (central)
- Supporting Subdomain (needed, but not central)
- Generic Subdomain (auxiliary, can be either outsourced or purchased)
