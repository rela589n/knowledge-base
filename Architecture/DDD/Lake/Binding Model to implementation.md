> Tightly coupling the [[Code]] to the [[Domain Model|Model]] adds meaning to both from both sides ([[Code]] is obvious, and [[Domain Model|Model]] is relevant).

When there's some **business concept** (e.g. bus in the example of the book), it **must be present in the [[Code]]** as an **explicit substance** rather than an implicit ghost, existence of which may only be inferred between the lines.

When the [[Domain Model|Model]] changes, the [[Code]] expressing it must change as well, and vice versa.

Architects should stick with [[Down to earth modeling]].

[[Domain must be Isolated]]
