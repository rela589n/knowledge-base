[[Domain Driven Design|DDD]]

**Initial Prototype** is the **simplest thing that could possibly work**.

When multiple teams are working on the feature, it's much important get as quick feedback as possible. Otherwise, if all teams give all the features away on the last week, there'd be a lot of bugs with tough deadlines.

To sort this out, an Initial working prototype can be developed (like an endpoint that just takes in input and returns 200) so that every party can integrate needed services, and be sure that at least communication and input validation issues will not arise on the last week.

Basically, when starting new features we could implement prototypes in first few days, and then implement the actual features. 

It will be even easier for review, since code will contain only business logic rather than scaffolding logic.
