Module is a selection of objects based on their [[Domain Model|Domain Meaning]]; Module groups set of concepts with [[Low Coupling & High Cohesion|High Cohesion]].

Primary aim for [[Module|Modularity]] is **reduced cognitive load**, since there's a limited number of things we could think about at once.

Modules should tell the [[Cohesion|Cohesive]] story of the system, resulting in **conceptual clarity**.

[[Module|Modularity]] contributes to [[Ubiquitous Language]], and provides a good separation for the **means of communication**.

Most reasonable basis of the module is [[Aggregate]].

Every module must be possible to be understood with minimum number of references to other modules ([[Low Coupling & High Cohesion|Low Coupling]]).

> If your [[Domain Model|Model]] is telling a story, your [[Module]] is a chapter.
