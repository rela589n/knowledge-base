  - Modularity
---
A separate part of [[Domain Model]], a set of concepts with high [[Cohesion|cohesion]].

Primary aim for [[Module|Modularity]] is reduced cognitive load, since there's a limited number of things we could think about at once.

Module must tell the [[Cohesion|cohesive]] story of the system.
Usually the basis of the module is some [[Aggregate]].

Every module must be possible to be understood with minimum number of references to other modules.

Modules provide a good separation for the means of communication.

> If your [[Domain Model|Model]] is telling a story, your [[Module]] is a chapter.
