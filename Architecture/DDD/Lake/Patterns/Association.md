Associations represent relationships in the [[Domain Model]].

> Many-to-many (bidirectional) communicate very little about the nature of the relationship. Usually they should be re-considered.

A good design follows these rules:
- [[Imposing traversal direction]];
- [[Qualifying the relationships]];
- [[Distilling the Model]];
