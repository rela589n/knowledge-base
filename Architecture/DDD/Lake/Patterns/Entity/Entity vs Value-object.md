[[Entity]] has continuity, while [[Value Object]] has not.

If the object is not interchangeable with another object (or could not be exchanged at all), - that's [[Entity]] (even though it's identity could be borrowed from [[Aggregate Root]]).

If we could replace one object with another one, - that's [[Value Object]].
