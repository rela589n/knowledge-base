When new [[Specification]] **subsumes** old [[Specification]], it means that any candidate that satisfies new [[Specification]] would also satisfy old [[Specification]].

It is [[Implication]], if we deem the [[Specification]] as a [[Predicate]].

> Example: check that chemicals' required storage conditions have become more stringent.
> 
> We can check if new [[Specification]] meets all the requirements of the old [[Specification]].
