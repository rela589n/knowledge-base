When new [[Specification]] **subsumes** old [[Specification]], it means that any candidate that satisfies the new [[Specification]] would also satisfy the old [[Specification]].

It is [[Implication]], if we deem the [[Specification]] as a [[Predicate]].

> Example: check what chemical's required conditions have become more strict.
> 
> We can check if new [[Specification]] meets all the requirements of the old [[Specification]].
