[[Specification]] defines a criteria for the object that is not yet present. It **constrains object creation** to match the specified Criteria.

> Example from the book is about packing the chemicals into containers. Each Chemical has some required features (e.g. armored, ventilation, etc) that container must satisfy. You can use [[Specification]] both for [[Specification for Validation|Validation]] and for [[Specification for Building to order|Building to order]].
