Intention-Revealing Interfaces [[Expressing Concepts Explicitly|Express Concepts Explicitly]]. They present objects as concepts of meaning rather than just technical mechanisms.

If developer is forced to read the implementation because of inability to grasp from the interface, the [[Encapsulation]] is lost. ^3ddb73

It's the matter of making **code grained to each concept** so that every method is simple and even if dev opens it, it's obviously expressing itself in [[Declarative]] manner using [[Ubiquitous Language|Business Terms]].

Type names, method names, parameter names, - all this serves for the sake of Intention-revealing **[[Declarative]] Interfaces**.
