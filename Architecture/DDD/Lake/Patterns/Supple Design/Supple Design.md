- [[Distilling the Model]]
- [[Declarative Style of Design]]

It makes obvious **the [[Side-Effect|Effects]] of using [[Code]]**:
- [[Side-Effect-Free Functions]]
- [[Assertion|Assertions]]

It [[Drawing on Established Formalisms|Draws on Established Formalisms]], and uses [[Closed Operation|Closure of Operations]].
