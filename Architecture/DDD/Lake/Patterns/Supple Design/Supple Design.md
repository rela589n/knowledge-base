**Supple Design** is expressive, adaptable, flexible Design that **communicates its intent**.

**Software** is for users just as for developers who need to support it. Clarity of [[Comprehension|Understanding]] is crucial.

It adds **clarity the [[Domain Model|Model]]**, limits [[Conceptual Overload]] by:
- [[Intention-Revealing Interface|Intention-Revealing Interfaces]] ([[Expressing Concepts Explicitly]])
- [[Conceptual Boundary|Conceptual Boundaries]] ([[Low Coupling & High Cohesion|Low Coupling]])
- [[Distilling the Model]]
- [[Declarative Style of Design]]

It makes easy to anticipate **the [[Side-Effect|Effects]] of running [[Code]]**:
- [[Side-Effect-Free Functions]]
- [[Assertion|Assertions]]

It [[Drawing on Established Formalisms|Draws on Established Formalisms]], and uses [[Closed Operation|Closure of Operations]].

It is achieved by [[Refactoring Toward Deeper Insight]].
