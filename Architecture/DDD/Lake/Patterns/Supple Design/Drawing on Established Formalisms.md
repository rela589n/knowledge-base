**Drawing on Established Formalisms** - using something already established (like math / accounting).

Sometimes you **don't have to invent** things manually. Common [[Domain|Domains]] have already been [[Model Refinement|Refined]], common problems have been solved, you can just draw on what's already there.

Do it when you can. For example, Shares Math highly utilized mathematical rigor to express Share Pie manipulations. Usage of familiar formalism makes your code easy to grasp.

Math is the perfect example of what people have [[Model Refinement|Refined]], and what people know. [[Extracting a hidden concept|Extract a hidden concept]] into a [[Value Object]], and utilize Math to express [[Domain|Business]] rules.
