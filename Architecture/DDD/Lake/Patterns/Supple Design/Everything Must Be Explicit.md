**Everything must be explicit.**

Not just [[Code]] that calculates something and returns the result, but [[Code]] that expresses the [[Domain Model|Model]] and [[Making implicit concepts explicit|Reveals concepts explicitly]].

Every calculation, every rule, every check, every assert, **<u><b>everything</b></u> must be explicit**.
