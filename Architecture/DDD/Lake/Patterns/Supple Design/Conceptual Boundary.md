[[Low Coupling & High Cohesion]] relates to [[Domain]] concepts as much as to [[Code]].

Don't split the implementation if there's no [[Conceptual Boundary]] there.

Observe the [[Axis of change|Axes of change]] and stability during [[Refactoring]] to [[Understanding|Understand]] the [[Conceptual Boundary|Conceptual Boundaries]].

Apply fundamental [[Low Coupling & High Cohesion]] concepts to detect the [[Conceptual Boundary|Boundaries]] of [[Subdomain|Subdomains]], [[Bounded Context|Bounded Contexts]], [[Module|Modules]], [[Aggregate|Aggregates]], and particular classes.
