Factory is part of [[Domain Model]] that bears **no business logic**, but rather [[Encapsulation|Encapsulates]] **objects creation logic**.

[[Factory incentive - Car example]]

Factory knows the internal structure of the object it creates.

The requirement of the Factory is that it must create domain objects only in valid state ([[Factory must keep the invariants]]).
