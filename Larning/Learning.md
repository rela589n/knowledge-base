To really learn something, you have to:

- understand the basics (e.g. bs, dfs, bfs, sliding window, etc);
- practice the basics;
- repeat the basics few times;
- learn the basics so good so that it's like ABC in primary school;
- only then do solve the problems with the basics;
- and repeat the solutions from day to day so that you really dig into it;
- try understanding the "why?", - why things work, what is the basis.

> If you taught a kid how to add numbers, and they understood it, it doesn't mean the'd be able to apply it a month after, unless they practice
