To really learn something, you have to:

- understand the basics (e.g. bs, dfs, bfs, sliding window, etc);
- practice the basics;
- repeat the basics few times;
- learn the basics so good so that it's like ABC in the primary school;
- only then do solve real problems with the basics;
- and repeat the solutions from day to day so that you really dig into it;
- try understanding the "why?", - why things work, what is the basis.

Use planning. Just a list of things to do. Don't get confused about what to do next.

You can associate some things with studying (like music). When you always listen particular music while you're studying, whey you turn it on, you're automatically switched to this mode.

When reading the book, you should really ask yourself questions: What do I expect from this chapter? What do I want to learn? What I want to do with this?
