**Composite** (aka **Object Tree**) is the design pattern, which allows to compose objects into tree structures and work with them via same interface as with individual objects.

> It lets to run a recursive algorithm over a tree.

## Applicability

- tree-like objects structure;
- when we want to treat complex compound items uniformly as a single leaves.
