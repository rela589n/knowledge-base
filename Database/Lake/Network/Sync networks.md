**Synchronous network** - when two nodes connect they **make up chain** with an **allocated bandwidth** amount for the entire route. While circuit is established, no one else can use this bandwidth. This leads to [[Network Bounded Delay]].

For example, you are guaranteed the ability to send 16 bits every 250 microseconds.

**Sync nets** are good **for continuous stream** data (video), but are **poor for bursty traffic** (requesting web page). ^3ba1a2
