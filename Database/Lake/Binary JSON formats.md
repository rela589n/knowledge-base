Both JSON and XML use a lot of space compared to binary formats. Therefore binary encodings of JSON (BSON, BJSON, UBJSON, BISON, Smile) and XML (WBXML, Fast Infoset) were developed, but none of them are as widely used as plain-text values.

Some of the formats add support for binary data, integers and floats, but otherwise keep unchanged. As far as no schema is prescribed, field names have to be saved for each document anyway.
