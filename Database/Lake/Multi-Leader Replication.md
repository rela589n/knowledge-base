**Multi-leader** (**master-master**, **active-active**) replication - **multiple nodes accept writes**, each of them forwards data to other nodes. Each leader may be a follower to another leader.

This [[Use-cases for multi-leader-replication|multi-leader replication use cases]] benefits rarely outweigh the complexity, therefore it is **not much used**.

With multi-leader replication its very likely that [[Handling write conflicts|conflicts must be handled]].

The log stream must somehow go from one leader to all others. See [[Multi-leader Replication Topologies]].
