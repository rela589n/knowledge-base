If operation B **knows about** A or if it **depends on** A, or **builds upon** A in some way, then B is **causally dependent** on A. From other side, event A **happens before** B.

If **operations are dependent** on each other (no [[Concurrent operations|concurrency]]), then **latter overwrite** former.
