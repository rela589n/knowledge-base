**Shared-Disk Architecture** - an array of **disks** is accessible by multiple machines (having independent CPU and RAM) **via fast network** (Network-Attached Storage, Storage Area Network). Useful for some [[Data Warehouse]] workloads.

**[[Scalability]] is limited** because of connection and locking overhead.
