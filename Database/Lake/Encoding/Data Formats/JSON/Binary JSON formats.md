JSON and XML use a lot of space compared to binary formats.

Binary encodings of JSON ([[CBOR]], BSON, BJSON, UBJSON, BISON, Smile) and XML (WBXML, Fast Infoset).
They are not as widely used as plain-text values.

Some of the formats add support for binary data, integers and floats, but otherwise keep unchanged. As far as no schema is prescribed, field names have to be saved for each document anyway.
