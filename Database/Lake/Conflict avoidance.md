The recommended approach to deal with conflicts for most of the cases is **to avoid the conflicts**. The particular records are allowed to be edited only from particular leader. 

For example, if application allows user to edit their own profile data, **each user will have "home" datacenter**, where all his writes will come to. It's selection may depend on geographic location.
