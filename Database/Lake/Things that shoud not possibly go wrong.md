The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that **possibly can not go wrong** is that when a thing that can not posiibly go wrong **goes wrong**, it usually turns out to be **impossible to get at or repair**. ^185b2e

Assuming that anything that **could possibly go wrong will go wrong** is a reasonable assumption, which allows us to **prevent issues before they happen**. ^76f1bd

In distributed systems **suspicion, pessimism, paranoia pay off**. We should **consider all faulty scenarios**, even unlikely ones. We need to **build reliable system from unreliable components**. ^a30368
