[[PostgreSQL]] introduced [[PostgreSQL Table Inheritance|Table Inheritance]] feature. Yet, it has a lot of limitations, which makes it unusable for table inheritance.

[[Partitioning Test]] showed that there are similar possibilities with [[Partitioning]] as it is implemented in [[PostgreSQL]].

It would have been an easy to use solution had it supported schema deviations for the child tables.
