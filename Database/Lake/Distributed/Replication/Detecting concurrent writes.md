When two clients concurrently modify the same piece of data, some nodes may **receive updates in the different order**. 
- Node1 may receive update from client A, and not receive from B (due to network issue);
- Node2 may receive first update from A, then from B;
- Node3 may receive first update from B, then from A.

[[LWW (last write wins)]] may be used for discarding concurrent writes, but **it implies data loss**. 

To handle concurrent writes sensibly, **explicit tracking of [[Capturing the happens-before relationship|dependent and concurrent]] operations** is necessary.
