**Real-time (hard real-time) systems** provide **response time guarantees**. These are systems, where safety is critical (aircrafts, cars, rockets).

**[[Process Pauses]] are not acceptable** for [[Real-time systems]], since having such would lead to unbounded response time, while it has to be restricted. ^a36850

The **software**, OS, languages, libraries which can be used is **strictly limited** and such must meet guarantess. It makes RT **really expensive** in terms of development and testing.
