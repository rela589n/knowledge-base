**Partially synchronous model** - [[System Models by timing assumptions|model]], by which system operates like [[Synchronous model]] most of the time, but from time to time **unexpected delays may occur**, which may be arbitrarily large.

[[Partially synchronous model|Partially synchronous]] systems should be **ready to cope with [[Network Unbounded Delay|Unbounded Network Delays]], [[Clock drifts]], [[Process Pauses]]**.
