A situation that happens when two related resources are locked by two different actors, resulting in each one waiting for another to release the lock.

This could be represented as a violin and bow. Consider the scenario when two actors would like to play a symphony. First one takes violin, while the second one takes the bow. Neither of these will release the lock until he completes his job. They will be waiting quite a while.
