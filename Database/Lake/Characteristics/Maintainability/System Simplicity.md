**Simplicity** - tackling complexity.

When **system is complex** is is usual thing for **budgets and schedules to be overrun**.

Reduction of complexity doesn't mean reduction of functionality. It means **reduction of unintended, accidental complexity**, which we can avoid.

Complexity can be removed by **introduction of abstractions**. Good abstraction hides implementation details behind neat facade.

When using abstraction, we of course use all low-level details, however we do not use it directly, because abstraction allows us to not think about it.
