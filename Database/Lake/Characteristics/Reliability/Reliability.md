**Reliability** - is the feature of software such that it **continues working** properly even if things do **not go expected** way. Reliable systems are **fault tolerant or resilient**. ^def-reliability

### Faults

There are three **types of faults** that make system not reliable:
- [[Hardware Faults]];
- [[Software Faults]];
- [[Human Faults]].

### Importance

Outages in software and programmatic bugs usually cost lost **profit** and lost **reputation**. However sometimes software may have reduced reliability in case of development for untapped market (RAD). ^reliability-importance
