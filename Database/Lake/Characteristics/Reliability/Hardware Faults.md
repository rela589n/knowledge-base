**Hardware Faults** (disk, memory, cpu, network, power, etc). 

Don't fail together unless by **common cause**. 
If One hard disc crashing, it's unlikely that reserved one will crash also. ^616ce6

It makes sense to **deliberately *trigger*** some **test faults** in order to check how software operates and **make sure** that **faults are recoverable**. For instance, we'd need to **anticipate [[Network Faults]]**, **node power offs** etc. ^deliberate-errors
