**Local index** - each partition additionally **holds secondary index of its own documents** besides of the data itself.

> If DB **supports only key-value** storage, it is dangerous to implement custom secondary indexes. A **great care** is required to make them **consistent** with the **underlying data**. Issues: **race conditions**, intermittent **write failures** easily cause data get out of sync.

**Scatter-gather** - secondary index read approach which implies **querying all partitions for secondary index** to get list of used documents. It is prone to the **[[Tail Latency Amplification]]**. 
Nonetheless, it is used in #Cassandra , #VoltDB, #MongoDB, #Riak , #ElasticSearch, #SolrCloud.

The **benefit** is that **writes are still performant**, since secondary index will be maintained **per partition basis**.

The **drawback** is **worse read performance**, sincce secondary index has to be analyzed **on all partitions**.
