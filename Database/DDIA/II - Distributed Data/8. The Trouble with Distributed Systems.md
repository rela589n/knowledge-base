## Faults and Partial Failures

![[Partial failures]]

### Cloud Computing and Supercomputing

Traditional **enterprise datacenters** are something **between** **supercomputing** and **cloud-computing**.

**Supercomputing** - computing on **machine with thousands of CPUs** which are used for high computations. Usually failure here means **complete system failure**.

**Cloud-computing** - computing based on **multi-tenant datacenters** having ordinary computers. **[[Partial failures]]** happen here.

Internet services are different from supercomputing:
- service is **not acceptable to be offline** (for instance, repair);
- for cloud services **no expensive special hardware** is affordable;
- datacenters **use IP Ethernet network** for communication, not specialized topologies;
- in big systems there's **always something broken**, yet the **system still has to continue** its operation;
- system tolerating failed nodes is **simple for maintenance** - it is possible to do a **rolling upgrade**, installing **security patches** on nodes, **restart node** while system still serve user requests;
- distributed systems may have their **nodes scattered across the world**, while supercomputers expect close distance between each other.

## Summary

Problems happen in distributed systems:
- network packets may be lost or delayed, response may be lost as well;
- node clock may fall out of sync, letting time jump back and forth;
- a process may be paused for a long time and node won't notice this.

Parital failures occur in distributed systems. They must cope with them.

For faults detection, mostly the timeouts are used. Even though, [[False Positive|false positives]] arise.

To solve partial failures, no one can trust a single node knowledge. Instead, [[Quorum]] decision is taken.

If it is possible to solve the problem on a single node, it's worth doing so, because single node solutions are more reliable and faults are deterministic.
