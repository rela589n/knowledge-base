## Faults and Partial Failures

![[Partial failures]]

### Cloud Computing and Supercomputing

Traditional **enterprise datacenters** are something **between** **supercomputing** and **cloud-computing**.

**Supercomputing** - computing on **machine with thousands of CPUs** which are used for high computations. Usually failure here means **complete system failure**.

**Cloud-computing** - computing based on **multi-tenant datacenters** having ordinary computers. **[[Partial failures]]** happen here.

Internet services are different from supercomputing:
- service is **not acceptable to be offline** (for instance, repair);
- for cloud services **no expensive special hardware** is affordable;
- datacenters **use IP Ethernet network** for communication, not specialized topologies;
- in big systems there's **always something broken**, though **system still has to continue** its operation;
- system tolerating failed nodes is **simple for maintenance** - it is possible to do a **rolling upgrade**, installing **security patches** on nodes, **restart node** while system still serve user requests;
- distributed systems may have their **nodes scattered across the world**, while supercomputers expect close distance between each other.

## Summary

Problems happen in distributed systems:
- network packets may be lost or delayed, response may be lost as well;
- node clock may fall out of sync, letting time jump back and forth;
- a process may be paused for a long time and node won't notice this.

Parital failures occur in distributed systems. They must cope with them.

For faults detection, mostly the timeouts are used. Even though, false positives arise.

To solve partial failures, no one can trust a single node knowledge. Instead, quorum decision is taken.

If it is possible to solve the problem on a single node, it's worth doing so, because single node solutions are more reliable and faults are deterministic.
