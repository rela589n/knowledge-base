![[Replication]]

## Summary

Replication **purposes**:
- **increase availability** - system operates even if some nodes are down;
- **disconnected operation** - app continues to work even though there are network issues;
- **reduce latency** by placing data centers which are close to users;
- **scalability** - serve read requests from replicas.

As a bare minumum app using replication must **deal with** **network issues** and **nodes outage**.

Replication **types**:
- **single-leader**
- **multi-leader**
- **leaderless**

Replication **synchronization types**:
- **sync** - not that fast as async, badly handles nodes outage;
- **async** - requires anticipation of app behavior in case when replication lag increases.

Replication **consistency models**:
- **read-after-write** - users should **see their submitted data**.
- **monotonic reads** - once some information is displayed to the user, he **should not see more obsolete data** than already shown to him;
- **consistent prefix reads** - causal dependencies must be kept (question comes first, then answer).

In **multi-leader and leaderless** replication types the **conflicts may arise**. To solve them one can use:
- **automatic** conflict resolution (like [[LWW (last write wins)]], usage of **CRDT**s);
- **manual** resolution using **versions** and **version vectors**.
