# 1. Reliable, Scaleable, Maintainable applications

Most **applications** are **data intensive** rather than compute-intensive. Knowing **how to design them** is more in demand than knowledge of some algorithms.

## Summary

Every system has 2 **types of requirements**:
- **Functional** (what system should actually do);
- **Non-Functional** (security, reliablity, compliance, scalability, compatibility, maintainability)

[[Reliability]] means system works correctly in case of faults. Faults can be hardware, software and human. Fault-tolerant systems hide some faults from end-users.

[[Scalability]] means having strategies to cope with increased load. In order to talk about scalability, two things should be described quantitatively: load and performance. Scalable system anticipates adding processing capacity to remain reliable under high loads.

[[Maintainability]] means making life easier for devs and ops. For devs: good abstractions. For ops: visibility into system health, ways to manage it.
