CORS - headers that are sent from backend that are going to be analysed by web browser to accept is as legitimate or reject it as spoiled. So, returning CORS Allow Origin as example.com, this will say to the browser to accept the response only if current url is example.com.

This prevents from attacks such as copied web-site that is redirecting traffic to the upstream backend.
