**Try - Confirm/Cancel (TCC)** is based on the idea of **reservations**.

**Similar to** manually implemented **[[Two-phase commit|2PC]]**, where:
- the first **(Try) phase** is making change to **reserve**:
	- **[[Microservices|Microservice]]** itself *calls* others to do **reservations**;
- the second **(Confirm/Cancel) phase**:
	- if **[[Microservices|Microservice]] goes down**:
		- **automatic cancel** happens *after* **reservation timeout**;
	- otherwise **call**:
		- **confirm** to commit;
		- **cancel** to rollback.
	 on the orchestrator.

Yet, it's **different** *from* **[[Two-phase commit|2PC]]** because it's 
**[[Microservices|Microservice]] itself** that *initiates* **reservations**.

If something goes wrong **after Try phase**, it's all 
automatically canceled after **reservation timeout**.
