You aren't tied to any particular place to work from or any particular company to work for.

The schedule is very flexible. You could work in the morning while your kids are out in the scholl, and then you could pick them up and spend some time with them, finishing your work in the evening when they go to bed.

Your productivity is non-linear. Sometimes you work and push forward for some great feature that you have in mind and the other days you just aren't productive and so you don't have to show up 9 to 5 every day. When you are productive, you work more. When you are down or burned out, you could take some rest.
