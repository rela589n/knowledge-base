The rule of thumb is that:

> Anything that attracts the audience over the internet can be turned into the income.

The main revenue is your **popularity**. You should utilize it.

There are open-source companies that **provide paid services**. People using their projects hire them to solve some particular problems they couldn't or aren't willing to solve themselves.

Another way is by [[Sponsorship platforms|sponsorship]]. Yet, this model doesn't always work in practice, because actual consumers usually just install your software and don't pay you any money for the product they use. Vue.js (authored by Evan You), having over a million users, has only a few hundreds sponsors. Yet, this is the main source of income for Vue.

I think one could promote sponsorship by requiring at least 1$ of monthly payment for documentation. So, everything is free, but to have the docs to read, you'll have to pay. Documentation should be licenced. Payment should be made as subscription, and not one-off payment, to prevent people from paying just again when they open docs.

Actually, docs could available for some time slot (somehow copying should be prevented). This should not prevent new people from viewing it, but those who already use the lib.

There are also partnerships. Like you can post some of the companies built on top of your project on your website (ads). Video teaching programs that generate income from teaching your framework could kick back some revenue back to you.

The main goal of open-source is not making the money out of it. The goal is to have the ability to keep working on it by the money passively coming to you by from it. You could start a business out of it, but this way you will have to run the business, not to do the actual programming.

For the companies using your software it is a good marketing to sponsor your project (even 10 dollars per month), since their logo will pop up at github, and people will see it and know that this company is sponsoring such a good project.

There's option for opensource to make a well-used library, but provide **proprietary upgrade**. So, they don't have to pay for using, but they **have to pay for upgrade** toward the new versions. An access to private github repository can be granted for sponsorship.

Access can only be granted for the user, who's at least registered for some time (5 months), or who's verified. Access is granted by public key. Thence, if they need to use it, they'd need their private key.
