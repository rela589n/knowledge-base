This is the compiler of [[Protobuf|Protocol Buffers]] .proto files into language-specific formats.

For example, in order to convert `message.proto` file into java class, you'd need [[Protoc compiler]] and java plugin. The same applies to other programming languages.

It can be installed from releases page: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
