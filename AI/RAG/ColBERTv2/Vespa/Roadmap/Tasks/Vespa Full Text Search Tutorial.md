Implement full text search.
See also [sample-app](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/text-search).

Create a simple [[Best Match 25|BM25]] [rank profile](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/basics/schemas.html#rank-profiles) and use it for the query.
Try comparing it to native rank. 

Try adding a new [synthetic field](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/basics/schemas.html#synthetic-fields). Is it available for search on the existing documents right after deployment?
