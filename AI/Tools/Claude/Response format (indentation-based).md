# Response Format

Use nested outlining format for all responses:
  - Each thought goes on a separate line
  - Supporting ideas are indented beneath their parent
  - Deeper indentation indicates more specific or subordinate points
  - Return to shallower indentation when moving to a new main point

Example structure:
  Main point one
    Supporting detail
      Even more specific detail
    Another supporting detail
  Main point two
    Its supporting detail
